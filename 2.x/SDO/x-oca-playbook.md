## x-oca-playbook

The current Course of Action object type in STIX 2.1 supports basic use cases such as sharing prose
courses of action but does not support the ability to represent structured and automated courses of
action, like orchestration workflows, or contain properties to represent metadata about courses of
action. Playbook objects encode such processes and may do so in various formats such as CACAO or
BPMN. The IOB Sub-Project wishes to thank Dr. Vasileios Mavroeidis and his teams at University of
Oslo / Cyentific AS for their technical discussions on best practices to represent CACAO playbooks
within STIX. Field names and descriptions from their playbook SDO specification document are used
here.

| property name            | type                       | description
|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type (required)          | `string`                   | The value of this property MUST be the literal "x-oca-playbook" |
| playbook_id              | `string`                   | A value that identifies the playbook. If the playbook (itself) includes an identifier, then playbook_id SHOULD use the same identifier for correlation purposes. It is recommended to use either UUIDv4 or deterministic UUIDv5 identifiers —if supported. |
| name (required)          | `string`                   | The name used to identify the Playbook. |
| description              | `string`                   | An explanation, details, and more context about what this playbook does and tries to accomplish. |
| playbook_creator         | `identifier`               | The identifier of SDO identity that created the playbook. If this object references a CACAO v2.0 playbook, then the value of this property SHOULD match the value of the created_by property in the CACAO playbook. |
| playbook_creation_time   | `timestamp`                | The time at which the playbook was originally created. If this object references a CACAO v2.0 playbook, then the value of this property SHOULD match the value of the created property in the CACAO playbook. |
| playbook_modification_time | `timestamp`              | The time at which the playbook was last modified. If this object references a CACAO v2.0 playbook, then the value of this property SHOULD match the value of the modified property in the CACAO playbook. |
| organization_type | `list` of type `open-vocab` | The type of organization that the playbook is intended for. The value for this property SHOULD come from the industry-sector-ov open vocabulary as defined in [STIX-v2.1]. If this object references a CACAO v2.0 playbook, then the value of this property SHOULD match the value of the (if populated) industry_sectors property in the CACAO playbook. Note that the [CACAO-Security-Playbooks-v2.0] extends the industry-sector-ov of [STIX-v2.1] with more sectors. |
| playbook_format          | `string`                   | The standard / format / notation the playbook conforms to (e.g., cacao, bpmn, ansible), or when not available, its encoding (e.g., .png or .pptx). When possible, this value SHOULD come from the values defined in the Template column of the IANA media type registry [Media Types]. For example, if a playbook is provided as an image in png format, the value following the IANA media type registry should be "image/png". Another example is CACAO security playbooks, where in [CACAO-Security-Playbooks-v2.0] Appendix C. IANA Considerations, the following media type is defined: "application/cacao+json". |
| is_playbook_template (required) | `boolean` |  This property verifies whether the playbook is a template or includes details for machine execution. A playbook could abstractly define and describe a structured process to be performed by cybersecurity personnel following up on a specific incident type or could detail actions up to the command level for an orchestrator to consume and execute it automatically by integrating and interacting with a set of systems and system components. Generally, playbooks for exchange will be vetted for confidential information and infrastructure details. Organizations and sharing parties and communities MAY define rules for what exactly constitutes a template playbook. |
| playbook_type            | `list` of type `open-vocab`    | A list of playbook types that specifies the operational roles this playbook addresses. The value for this property SHOULD come from the playbook-type-ov open vocabulary. If this object references a CACAO v2.0 playbook, then the value of this property SHOULD match the value of the (if populated) playbook_types property in the CACAO playbook. |
| playbook_impact | `integer` | A number (𝕎 - whole number) from 0 to 100 that represents the potential impact (as determined subjectively by the producer) the execution of the playbook might have on the organization and its infrastructure. Organizations and sharing parties and communities MAY establish clear rules for assigning this property. If specified, the value of this property MUST be between 0 and 100. When left blank, this means unspecified. A value of 0 means specifically undefined or benign. Impact values range from 1, the lowest impact, to a value of 100, the highest. Note that CACAO v2.0 playbooks also share the same property (impact) but producers of this SDO MAY assign different impact values based on their own rules. |
| playbook_severity | `integer` | A number (𝕎 - whole number) that represents the seriousness of the conditions that this playbook addresses. This is highly dependent on whether the playbook is a response to an incident (in which case the severity could be mapped to an incident category defined in some solution), a response to a threat (in which case the severity would likely be mapped to the severity of the threat faced or captured by threat intelligence), or a response to something else. Organizations and sharing parties and communities MAY establish clear rules for assigning this property. If specified, the value of this property MUST be between 0 and 100. When left blank, this means unspecified. A value of 0 means specifically undefined. Values range from 1, the lowest severity, to 100, the highest. Note that CACAO v2.0 playbooks also share the same property (severity) but producers of this SDO MAY assign different impact values based on their own rules. |
| playbook_priority | `integer` | A number (𝕎 - whole number) that represents the priority of this playbook relative to other defined playbooks. Priority in this context is a subjective assessment; thus, organizations, sharing parties, and communities of playbooks MAY define rules on how priority should be assessed and assigned. This specification does not address how this assessment is determined. This property is primarily to allow such usage without requiring the addition of a custom property for such practices. This property can support different use cases and requirements of a producing or consuming entity. For example, two playbook objects focused on the same malware could use the priority property to indicate that the execution of a remediation playbook is preferred compared to a mitigation playbook. If specified, the value of this property MUST be between 0 and 100. When left blank, this means unspecified. A value of 0 means specifically undefined. Values range from 1, the highest priority, to a value of 100, the lowest. The values of 1-100 in this property are inverted from playbook_severity and playbook_impact based on how the concept of priority is used today. For example, in a SOC, a P1 ticket is a higher priority than a P4 ticket. Note that CACAO playbooks also share the same property (priority), but producers of this SDO MAY assign different impact values based on their own rules. |
| playbook_bin             | `binary`                   | The entire playbook encoded in base64. This property allows the sharing and retrieval of entire playbooks. This property MUST NOT be present if the playbook_url property is populated. As playbooks can become quite large, implementers MAY decide to use the playbook_url property to support lightweight message exchange. |
| playbook_url | `string` |  The value of this property MUST be a valid URL that resolves to a non-encoded playbook (playbook in its native format). This property MUST NOT be present if the playbook_bin property is populated. |
| playbook_hashes | `hashes` | Specifies a dictionary of hashes for the playbook itself. The hashes MUST be calculated by using the playbook in its native format. This property can be used to ensure the integrity of the playbook retrieved from the playbook_url property. This property MUST be present when the playbook_url property is present. Dictionary keys MUST come from the hash-algorithm-ov open vocabulary. |
